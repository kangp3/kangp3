I'm a full-stack engineer with a breadth of experience gained mostly from doing
the startup dance. Can do the zero-to-one, the pivot, the migration, the
whoa-maybe-we-step-back-and-introduce-tests. Have been privileged to learn from
many smart people along the way. Love to theorize about how to properly make
systems scale, and dive in to examine why things broke when those theories
prove incomplete.
